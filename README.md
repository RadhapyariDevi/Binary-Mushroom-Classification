# Binary-Mushroom-Classification
A machine learning web app built with Streamlit to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics which includes key features like color, size, and shape, to make accurate predictions.

**Machine Learning Algorithm used:** XG Boost Classifier

**Dataset:** [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e8/data)

**Live Demo:** [Streamlit](https://binary-mushroom-classification-is7lywwaew2jejpjyn6xuw.streamlit.app/)

## Tech Used:
Python \
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning) \
Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing) \
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization) \
Streamlit (Web App) 

## How to used:
**Training process** of the model is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, which is available in this repository. [click here](https://github.com/RadhapyariDevi/Binary-Mushroom-Classification/blob/main/mushroom%20_classification_model.ipynb)
